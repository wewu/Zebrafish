== ZebraFish proteomics project website

The site is built on top of a BioSQL like schema and 
the excellent Ruby on Rails (RoR) webapp framework. I'll rely on that 
project to document the view and contoller logic, since it is 
largely part of the public domain and easily accessible.

Where the implementation has strayed from a CRUD application 
(e.g. the image manipulation) we will document those classes 
in the RDoc of the class.

The database install procedure and schema are documented in README.db


== Install and Usage
To use the site "as-is" install Ruby and RoR as per their instructions. 
You will also need the following gems:

ruby 1.8.4 (not other versions, esp 1.8.5)
rails 1.1.6
mysql 2.7
...

You can use the webrick server as any other rails application, 
but we recommend the mongrel gem for running the application 
for longer periods of time.

Have fun!
