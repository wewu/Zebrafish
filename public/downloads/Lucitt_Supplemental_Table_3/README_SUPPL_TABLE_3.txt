README Supplemental Table 3, Lucitt et. al., Zebrafish Proteomics

-----------------------------------------------------------

This supplemental table of unique peptide protein identifications contains hyperlinks to local html pages that contain the annotated mass spectra. 
The suppl. table is included in a zipped archive file, which - when unzipped successfully - will create a number of subfolders that structured to provide the linked
mass spectra information. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

To unzip (extract) the archive folder do the following:

For Windows:
1. Copy the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3.zip onto your hard disk e.g. into the My Documents folder.
2. Right-click on the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3.zip. (Attention: double-clicking will not correctly extract the archive file). 
3. Select: "Extract All...", which will open the Compressed (zipped) Folder Extraction Wizard.
4. Click: "Next", which will take you to the Selection of Destination view. 
5. Start the extraction into a folder of your choice. (If no folder is selected, a new folder "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3" will be created.)
6. The extraction process will create a folder "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3" at your selected destination. (If no destination folder was selected, two "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3" folders will have been created within each other).
7. Open the folder by double-clicking.
8. Open the Excel-File named "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3.xls", which contains the links to the MS/MS spectra.

For Macs:
1. Copy the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3.zip onto your hard disk.
2. Double-click on the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3.zip.
3. This will extract (unzip) the archived files into a folder named "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3". 
4. Open the folder by double-clicking.
5. Open the Excel-File named "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_3.xls", which contains the links to the MS/MS spectra.

MS/MS Spectra:
Click on the "entry no." links to view the respective MS/MS spectra. The link will take you to a view that shows the charge state(s) of the unique identifying peptide ion. 
Fragmentation spectra of the same peptide were often recorded in multiple charge states. E.g. 2_GEEAAGEASGSQEQPEPALAEPK indicates that the peptide ion was
doubly charged. Clicking on a peptide sequence will open a new page that shows one or more spectra numbers (within our data set) and their peptide probablitites as 
estimated by PeptideProphet. We are showing only the spectrum with the best peptide probablity (even if the peptide was identified by multiple spectra). If multiple spectra
share the best peptide probablitity we are showing up to three spectra with this probability (even if there are more). 
Open a spectrum link to view the annotated spectrum in a webpage created by the Transproteomics Pipeline (Institute of Systemsbiology, Seattle, WA; http://sashimi.sourceforge.net/index.html).
