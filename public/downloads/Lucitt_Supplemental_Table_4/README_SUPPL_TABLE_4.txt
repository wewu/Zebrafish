README Supplemental Table 4, Lucitt et. al., Zebrafish Proteomics

-----------------------------------------------------------

This supplemental table of unique peptide protein identifications contains hyperlinks to local html pages that contain the annotated mass spectra. 
The suppl. table is included in a zipped archive file, which - when unzipped successfully - will create a number of subfolders that structured to provide the linked
mass spectra information. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

To unzip (extract) the archive folder do the following:

For Windows:
1. Copy the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4.zip onto your hard disk e.g. into the My Documents folder.
2. Right-click on the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4.zip. (Attention: double-clicking will not correctly extract the archive file). 
3. Select: "Extract All...", which will open the Compressed (zipped) Folder Extraction Wizard.
4. Click: "Next", which will take you to the Selection of Destination view. 
5. Start the extraction into a folder of your choice. (If no folder is selected, a new folder "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4" will be created.)
6. The extraction process will create a folder "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4" at your selected destination. (If no destination folder was selected, two "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4" folders will have been created within each other).
7. Open the folder by double-clicking.
8. Open the Excel-File named "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4.xls", which contains the links to the MS/MS spectra.

For Macs:
1. Copy the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4.zip onto your hard disk.
2. Double-click on the file Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4.zip.
3. This will extract (unzip) the archived files into a folder named "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4". 
4. Open the folder by double-clicking.
5. Open the Excel-File named "Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4.xls", which contains the links to the MS/MS spectra.

--------------------------------------------------------

To view the annotated PMF spectra:
Click on the "annotated PMF spectrum ID (link)" links within Supplemental Table 4 to view the respective PMF spectra.
The PMF spectra can also be viewed independently of the Excel-Table by opening the index.html file in the folder Lucitt_Supplemental_Table_4.

To view the annotated MS/MS Spectra:
If MS/MS spectra are available, these can be opened by clicking on the "annotated MSMS spectrum ID (link)". 
MS/MS spectra can also be opened from the PMF spectra view by clicking the peptide sequence
